#Project			
System for Testing Performance And Audit Web Application (Telexi

This project was designed to test the other system functionality, resource e.g. Garbage Collection and auditing. The project was developed by JavaScript on Express framework which I manage to Implement the other Cutting-edge technology for example ReactiveX, mongoDB, SSE ,Lighthouse Firebase Authentication, Git and Docker also keep the UI up-to-date.
To use this project, Users simply compress the other web application or basic NodeJs to zip file.
Then upload via the “step by step” on the system web pages then system will begin the automatic testing, monitoring performance and generate any output to the user in real-time. Finally, the system will display the summery and audit reports for the user. The purpose of the outputs that user got are intended to compare changes of user’s project each iteration. Which have benefit for the Quality Assurance, straightforward, Improved the length of develop cycle. thus, create a good development practice for the us
